## About

This is my first album. You can listen to it on [Bandcamp][2] or
[SoundCloud][3]. It's not much of an album, with 5 songs at 2 minutes each it's
about 10 minutes long.

It's written in [Renoise][1]. I created all the samples myself with the
exception of the drum kit.

I used the following Renoise tools:

 * <http://www.renoise.com/tools/scale-finder>
